This workshopper is intended as a gentle introduction to the sometimes
challenging (and, to be frank, upsetting) world of debugging Node
programs. You should have about as much Node knowledge as you would
get from running the learnyounode workshopper, and having gone through
the original workshopper, stream-adventure, wouldn't hurt either.

While you should have a complete Node development environment
available (with both Node and npm installed at their latest stable
version, and whatever build tools are required to compile native
modules on your system), this tutorial is more about general
strategies than using specialized tools. When you're done, you should
feel well-equipped to figure out what's wrong with the modules
you're developing, and to make your production systems easier to
troubleshoot.

## CHALLENGE

To proceed, write a program that prints "i am okay" to standard output
and "i am so incredibly not okay" to standard error.
